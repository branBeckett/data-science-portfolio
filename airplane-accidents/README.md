# Investigating Airplane Accidents

In this project, we'll look at a dataset of airplane accident statistics and analyze patters to see if there are any common threads.

We're going to work with a dataset of 77,282 avviation accidents that occured in the U.S. The data in our `AviationData.txt` file comes from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and can be downloaded [here](https://www.ntsb.gov/Pages/default.aspx).
