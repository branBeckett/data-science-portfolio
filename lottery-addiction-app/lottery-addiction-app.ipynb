    "* one_ticket_probability() to calculate the probability of winning the jackpot with a single ticket\n",
    "* check_historical_occurrence() to checks if a certain combination has occurred before in the dataset\n",
    "* multi_ticket_probability() to calculate the probability for having any number of tickets for a drawing\n",
    "* small_prize_probability() to calculate the probability of having a two, three, four or five winning number match\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to continue building more features into our app, some next steps could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make the outputs even easier for the user to understand by adding memorable analogies of strange events that occur in life at similar probabilities.\n",
    "* Combine the `one_ticket_probability()` and `check_historical_occurrence()` functions to output probability and historical occurrence information at the same time.\n",
    "* Create another function similar to `small_prize_probability()`, but one that calculates the probability of having at least two, three, four, or five winning numbers instead of the quantity entered exactly.\n",
