    "# Clean and Analyze Employee Exit Surveys\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will clean and analyze exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training, and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education Body (TAFE) of Queensland, Australia. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The DETE exit survey can be found [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey).\n",
    "* The TAFE exit survey can be found [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will work under the context that our stakeholders want us to combine the results of both surveys in order to determine if the employees who worked for the institutes for a short period of time only resigned due to some kind of job dissatisfaction. We will also look at age to see if these issues affect younger or older employees differently.\n",
