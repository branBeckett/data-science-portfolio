# Predicting the Stock Market

In this project, we'll be working with data from the S&P500 Index. We'll use historical data on the priceo f the S&P500 to attemt to make accurate predictions about future prices. Predicting whether and index will go up or down can help us forecast how the stock market as a whole might perform. Likewise, it can also help us make economic forecasts since the stock market tends to correlate with how well the economy is doing.
