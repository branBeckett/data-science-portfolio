# Predicting the Stock Market

Note: This project does not provide any investment or trading advice, and trades should not be made using any models developed in this project. This projects is for informational purposes only.

In this project, we'll be working with data from the S&P500 Index. We'll use historical data on the price of the S&P500 to attemt to make accurate predictions about future prices. Predicting whether and index will go up or down can help us forecast how the stock market as a whole might perform. Likewise, it can also help us make economic forecasts since the stock market tends to correlate with how well the economy is doing.

Our dataset is stores in `sphist.csv` and contains a daily record of index prices from 1950 to 2015. We'll use this data to develop a predictive model by training the model with data from 1950-2012, and testing our predictions on the data from 2013-2015.

The idea for this project comes from the [DATAQUEST](https://app.dataquest.io/) **Machine Learning in Python: Intermediate** course.
